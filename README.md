# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

## Overview

The purpose of the project is to tidy up activity data collected from accelerometers and gyroscopes in smartphones.

The dataset for the project is

## R Script

run_analysis.R performs the following steps:

1. Download the data if necessary.
2. Merges the training and test sets to create one dataset.
3. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
4. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the dataset.
5. Appropriately labels the dataset with descriptive variable names.
6. From the dataset in step 5, creates a new file named averagedData.txt., which contents independent tidied dataset with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

CodeBook.md explains the structure of the script in more detail.

## Output
The results are provided in the file averagedData.txt.
